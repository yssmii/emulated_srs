# obstacle_classifier.launch

## Usage

1. Run the sensor package to publish the organized PC2 topics;

        roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_rgbd.launch       # if realsense-ros

2. Run obstacle_classifier.

        roslaunch emulated_srs obstacle_classifier.launch

## ROS args

- _zkey_: The limit distance of detection. Pixels that are farther away from
  the sensor than this distance are excluded from the obstacle detection.
  (default: 1500.0 [mm])
- _min_gap_of_occluding_boundary_: The minimum distance of occluding contours.
    If the 3D distance between two pixels adjacent on a distance image is
    greater than this value, they are regarded as being contained in separate
    objects. (default: 100.0 [mm])
- _min_pixels_as_object_: Minimum obstacle size on a distance image. If smaller
    than this, it is regarded as noise.ï¼ˆdefault: 500 [pixels])
- _min_overlap_rate_: The overlap rate on an image between an obstacle detected
    in a distance image and an object detected/classified in a corresponding RGB
    image by YOLO. If greater than this value, the obstacle is tagged with the
    YOLO object class. If smaller, it is tagged with "unknown". (default: 0.8)
- _use_mask_p_: If non-zero, the FOV is limited to the mask image. (default: 0)
- _display_images_p_: If non-zero, detection results are visualized and
    displayed with OpenCV. (default: 1)
- _publish_images_p_: If non-zero, detection results are visualized and
    published. (default: 0)
- _publish_markers_p_: If non-zero, detection results are published as
    visualization markers for rviz. (default: 0)
- _save_images_p_: if non-zero, subscribed PC2s are saved as depth and RGB
    image files, and detection results are saved as overwritten depth images.
    (default: 0)
- _filename_mask_: name of the mask file. (defaule: "MASK.png")
- _dirname_log_: name of the parent directory where the images will be saved,
    if save_images_p is non-zero. Within the directory, the child directories
    D/, I/, and R/ must be made. (default: "Data/")
- _topic_name_: topic name of PC2 to subscribe to. (default:
    "/camera/depth_registered/points")
- _sensor_name_: name of the sensor publishing the PC2 (default: "unknown")
- _experimental_doublecheck_p_: If non-zero, exec the experimental
    classification. (default: 0)
